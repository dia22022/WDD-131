            When I was young, I was always fascinated by the way my
mom was able to take amazing photos. The time and effort she put
into them to make them beautiful and unique. She taught me a lot,
and when she passed down her camera to me, I wanted to take it
everywhere. I love capturing moments in peoples lives. I feel like I
have the power to stop time and enjoy lifes wonderful views. After
years of classes and practicing on my own time, I hope to be able to
earn a spot at Adobe so I can do what I love most; travel and photograph for a living.
